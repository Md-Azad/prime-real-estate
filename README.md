# 🏡 Real Estate Platform

## 📌 Introduction

The **Real Estate Platform** is a modern web application built with the **MERN stack** that allows users to buy, sell, and manage real estate properties. The platform supports three roles:

- **User**: Can browse, wishlist, review, and purchase properties.
- **Agent**: Can add, update, and manage their listed properties.
- **Admin**: Has full control over property listings, users, and reviews.

With features like property verification, wishlist management, secure authentication, and real-time updates, this platform provides a seamless experience for both buyers and sellers.
